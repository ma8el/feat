# ADR-025 — Package layout additions and mechanical rule enforcement

Status: accepted
Recorded: 2026-08-04

Evidence found while bootstrapping the repository:

1. The suggested package list in [06-technical-architecture.md](06-technical-architecture.md) specifies the configuration, state, and runtime directory layout but gives it no owner. `internal/config`, `internal/store/fs`, and `internal/daemon` all need the same resolution, and making any one of them the owner creates a dependency the other two should not have.
2. Placing the Cobra tree in `cmd/feat` puts the whole command surface in `package main`, where it cannot be constructed by a test. The slice 0 acceptance criterion "`feat --help` shows the intended top-level command model" is only checkable if it can.
3. Several architectural and security rules in `CLAUDE.md` are import rules or source-content rules. Leaving them to review attention makes them likely to erode across fourteen slices.

Decisions:

- Add `internal/paths` as a standard-library-only leaf package owning configuration, state, and runtime directory resolution, including XDG overrides, safe `~` expansion, and the documented runtime-directory fallback. It resolves paths and does not create or mutate anything. Implemented by whichever of slice 2 or 3 needs it first.
- Add `internal/cli` for the command tree and process exit codes. `cmd/feat` keeps only signal handling and the exit call.
- Add `internal/version` for build identity, shared by `feat version`, the health screen, and `feat doctor`.
- Add `internal/guard` for repository-wide invariant tests. It contains no runtime code.
- Enforce import boundaries with `depguard` rules in `.golangci.yml` rather than by convention. A change to those rules is an architectural change and requires an ADR.
- Enforce the "no reference-project identifiers" scope rule and the "argument vectors, not interpolated shell commands" rule with AST tests in `internal/guard`. Exemptions are recorded in a reviewable denylist file, not in `//nolint` comments.
- Pin the command surface with a golden file so the published command model cannot drift silently.

Consequence: the acceptance criteria of slice 0 and CLAUDE.md scope rule 3 are checked by `go test ./...` and `golangci-lint run` on every change, on both target platforms.

This decision affects package layout only. It does not change any product behaviour, milestone, or scope boundary.
